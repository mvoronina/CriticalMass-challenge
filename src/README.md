# Challenge - Team Roster

## The Task

Using the roster data that is available in the `./data`
folder and the basic react.js application, that has been
created for you, do the following:

1. Write out the column totals in the `tfoot` section of the
   tables for each stat column.

2. Make each of the play names open a link to their ESPN
   page (see the URL of each player in the data).

3. On Click of any row in the grid, please render out a hockey card for that player.

   A reference to what the hockey card should look like is shown in hockey-card.jpg. Please render this card above the grid.

   The card should update every time a new player in the grid is clicked.
